# Digraph Forms v0.5

*This is not going to be the final version of Digraph Forms.*
I will be supporting the v0.5 branch with its current interface, at least for myself, because I am using it in a few production projects. Those projects are stuck on some pretty weird old custom builds of PHP, and so this branch will be maintaining PHP 5.3 compatibility for the foreseeable future. If you're on a more recent version than PHP 5.3 (as you very much should be), you shouldn't use this branch. You should instead wait for the 1.0 release, which should hopefully be in 2018 sometime. The 1.0 branch will fix a lot of conceptual shortcomings of the alpha versions, and is designed to target modern environments and take full advantage of all the features of PHP 7.1 that make it finally act something like a grown-up programming language.

So I guess in a nutshell: This version is relatively stable, and the author is actually using it in production. The interface shouldn't change significantly, unless I find something absolutely terrible. You still probably shouldn't use it, though, because it's targeting a truly decrepit version of PHP and better things are on the way.

Also this version will probably never be properly documented.
